# WordPress Messenger Customer Chat Plugin

# Description
What?

`WordPress Messenger Customer Chat Plugin` is Messenger's customer chat plugin for Wordpress.
This is the source code for the plugin which allows you to add a Messenger chat window directly onto
your website.

Why?

There is no current plugin in the market and we think it is cool.

How?

This Wordpress plugin automatically
places code on a website, reducing friction, chance for error, and simplifying
the installation process. Once installed and setup, creators will be able to
engage their users in a more personal way. Users can get their questions answered
from more businesses without leaving their website, and continue the conversation
in Messenger without losing history or context.
